# Release Me Action

This action uses
[Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to
create a new release of the repository checked-out under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`,
performing the following tasks:

- analyzes commits based on the
  [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
- updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file based on the analyzed commits
- optionally, bumps the NPM package version number
- optionally, commits workflow generated assets to the repository
- optionally, adds workflow generated assets to the release
- creates a GitHub release based on the analyzed commits

# Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      # Credentials used to perform the release and commit the updated assets
      # to the repository.
      # Required: true
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
    with:
      # Configure semantic release to run from a specific branch.
      # If not specified semantic-release will use its default branches
      # configuration, as specified in their Javascript API documentation:
      # https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#branches
      release-branches: '["+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x","master","next","next-major",{"name":"beta","prerelease":true},{"name":"alpha","prerelease":true}]',
      # Commit the new line separated glob patterns to the repository as part
      # of the release process.
      commit-assets: |
        ./dist
      # Run semantic release in dry-run mode.
      # Default: false
      dry-run: true
      # Bump the node module version and commit the changed package files to the
      # repository as part of the release process.
      # Default: false
      node-module: true
      # Attach the new line separated listed glob patterns to the release.
      release-assets: |
        ./generated/my-asset.tar.gz
```

**IMPORTANT** `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not have the required permissions to operate
on protected branches. If you are using this action to release to a protected
branch, replace the `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a
[GitHub Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
with the required permissions enabled on it.

## Create a release

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
```

## Test a release

Runs semantic release in dry-run mode on a branch different to master, omitting
to commit any assets or perform the actual release.

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
    with:
      dry-run: true
      release-branches: 'my-branch'
```

## Create a release to a different branch

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
    with:
      release-branches: 'releases'
```

## Create a release and update repository contents

Commit the listed glob patterns to the repository as part of the release
process.

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
    with:
      commit-assets: |
        ./dist
        ./public
```

## Create a release with attached artifacts

Attach the listed glob patterns to the release.

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
    with:
      release-assets: |
        ./generated/my-asset.tar.gz
```

## Create a release updating an npm package version

This configuration also updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json` or
`yarn-lock.yaml` files alongside `CHANGELOG.md`.

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
    with:
      node-module: true
```

## Create a release on a protected branch

This configuration uses a
[GitHub Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
to authenticate to GitHub.

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
```

## Create a release of a node module and publish it to multiple registries

This configuration showcases how to complement the release with publishing steps
for multiple package registries.

```yaml
steps:
  - env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Release
    uses: ridedott/release-me-action@master
    with:
      node-module: true
  - name: Setup Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v1
    with:
      registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
  - env:
      NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    name: Publish to GitHub Packages
    run: npm publish
  - name: Setup Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v1
    with:
      registry-url: 'https://registry.npm.org'
      # Scoped packages require the scope parameter to be set in the setup
      # node step when publishing to the npm registry.
      scope: '@my-organization'
  - env:
      NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    name: Publish to npm
    run: npm publish
```
